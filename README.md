# physics-lab

This is a web application for simulating mechanical physics in 2D with a server written in Node.js/Express.js, and all of the graphic part being handled by the library p5.js. The physics engine and all of the physics calculation were written by me. The main file from which all of the calculation and physics parts are being handled is `public/js/main.js`.

The main app can be accessed here: http://physicslab.herokuapp.com/ (doesn't work well on mobile).

To begin the interaction you must only press the buttons on the upper right like Mass or Incline and add them to the world (by clicking any part of the grid). You can toggle on thinks like gravity or the floor, and then just press Play on the bottom right. The code is not very commented.

This was done to participate on the Google Science Fair.
